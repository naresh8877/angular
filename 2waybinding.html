<p> Change the name the input field and you will see the name in the header changes
so in this ng-model directives provides two way data binding between the model and the view
    Two way data binding in Angularjs is the synchronization between the model and the view
    when data in the model changes the view reflects the change and when data in the view changes the model is updated as well.
    This happens immediately and automatioally which make sure that the model and the view is updated at all times
